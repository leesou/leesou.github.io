[*Peking University*](https://english.pku.edu.cn/)  
*Room 512, Science Building #5, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Beijing, China, 100871*  

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Guangyu Sun](http://ceca.pku.edu.cn/en/people_/faculty_/guangyu_sun/).
My research mainly focus on alleviating the memory wall problem via architecture and system innovations, especialy in deep learning scenarios (e.g., LLM inference & serving, large embedding model inference, emerging algorithms, etc.). I have published as the (co-)first author in top-tier computer architecture/system conferences including **ISCA, ASPLOS, HPCA (won best paper award), DAC, PACT**.
