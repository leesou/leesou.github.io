[*School of Integrated Circuits*](https://ic.pku.edu.cn/)  
[*Peking University*](https://english.pku.edu.cn/)  
*Room 512, Science Building #5, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Beijing, China, 100871*  

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Guangyu Sun](http://ceca.pku.edu.cn/en/people_/faculty_/guangyu_sun/).
My research primarily focuses on alleviating the memory wall problem through architectural and system innovations, particularly in deep learning scenarios (e.g., LLM inference and serving, large embedding model inference, and emerging algorithms).
I have published as the (co-)first author in top-tier computer architecture/system conferences including **ISCA (won best paper award), ASPLOS, HPCA (won best paper award), DAC, PACT**.
